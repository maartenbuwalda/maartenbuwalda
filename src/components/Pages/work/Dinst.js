      <h2>Dinst</h2>
      <p>Dinst was a social start-up focused on creating a platform for people who needed help at home. For instance, a carpenter could offer his/her services online, and anyone could get in contact for a task at home that needed fixing.</p>
      <p>Working here was one of my first experiences as a front-end developer. It was a part-time job during my second and third year of university. The Dinst platform was built by themselves with Joomla, in which I continued to improve upon using JavaScript, CSS3 and PhP. Next to that, Dinst was trying to get investments by competing in a "Rockstart" acceleration program. I created wireframes, mock-ups and contributed to their cool ideas. Finally they won the program and gained investments!</p>

      <p>Unfortunately I had to move away from Dinst to continue my studies and start my internship elsewhere. Fortunately, my next challenge was at Wakoopa, where I learned so much more.</p>
